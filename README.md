# False Sharing Demonstration Project

This project demonstrates the performance impact of false sharing in multi-threaded applications and shows how compile-time data transformations can mitigate these issues.

## üìö Background

This project is inspired by two seminal computer architecture papers:

1. **Dubois, Scheurich & Briggs (1990)** - "False Sharing and Spatial Locality in Multiprocessor Caches"
   - First formal definition and analysis of the false sharing problem
   - Identified how cache coherence protocols can cause performance degradation

2. **Jeremiassen & Eggers (1993)** - "Reducing False Sharing on Shared Memory Multiprocessors through Compile-Time Data Transformations"
   - Proposed compile-time solutions to eliminate false sharing
   - Introduced data padding and alignment techniques

## üéØ Project Goals

- **Demonstrate** the performance impact of false sharing in real multi-threaded code
- **Implement** compile-time mitigation techniques (padding/alignment)
- **Measure** and compare performance between unoptimized and optimized versions
- **Educate** about cache-conscious programming practices

## üìÅ Files Included

## üß™ Experimental Factors

### Factors that Enhance False Sharing Effects:
- **More CPU cores**: Higher parallelism increases cache contention
- **More threads**: Additional threads competing for cache lines
- **Higher iteration counts**: Longer runtime makes effects more measurable
- **Frequent memory updates**: More cache invalidation traffic
- **NUMA systems**: Cross-socket memory access amplifies the problem

### Factors that May Reduce Observable Effects:
- **Single-core systems**: No true parallelism, limited false sharing impact
- **Very fast cache coherence**: Some systems handle invalidation efficiently
- **Different cache line sizes**: Some architectures use 32-byte or 128-byte lines
- **Compiler optimizations**: May reorganize memory access patterns

## üéöÔ∏è Tuning Parameters

You can modify these parameters in the source code to see different effects:

```c
#define NUM_THREADS 4        // Try 2, 4, 8, 16
#define ITERATIONS 50000000  // Increase for longer tests
#define CACHE_LINE_SIZE 64   // Adjust for your system (32, 64, 128)
```

## üîç Understanding the Results

### What False Sharing Looks Like:
- High execution time despite parallel execution
- Poor scaling with additional threads
- High cache miss rates and memory stalls
- Excessive bus traffic between CPU cores

### What Good Performance Looks Like:
- Near-linear speedup with additional threads
- Low cache miss rates for each thread's data
- Minimal inter-core communication overhead
- Efficient use of memory bandwidth

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "OpenMP not found" Error:
- **Windows**: Install MinGW-w64 or use Visual Studio
- **Linux**: Install `libomp-dev` or `libgomp1-dev`
- **macOS**: Install with `brew install libomp`

### No Performance Difference Observed:
- Try increasing `ITERATIONS` (e.g., to 100000000)
- Increase `NUM_THREADS` to match your CPU core count
- Ensure you're running on a multi-core system
- Try running with system under normal load

### Compilation Errors:
- Ensure OpenMP support is installed
- Use `-fopenmp` flag (not `-openmp`)
- For older GCC versions, you may need `-lgomp`

## üî¨ Further Experiments

Try these modifications to deepen your understanding:

1. **Vary thread count**: Test with 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 threads
2. **Different data types**: Replace `int` with `long`, `double`, or custom structs
3. **Access patterns**: Modify how frequently each thread updates shared data
4. **Memory allocation**: Try heap-allocated vs stack-allocated data structures
5. **NUMA awareness**: On multi-socket systems, experiment with thread affinity
